# binaryTrees
I'm going to make a project to visualize binary trees, eventually visually demonstrating many of the operations we would want to do on them visually.

Goals include:
Search
Insert
Delete
Rebalancing
Converting different orderings
visually showing dfs and bfs, perhaps comparing 2 trees.
